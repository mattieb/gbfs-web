        A Web-based tool to pack files onto a ROM using
        <a href="https://pineight.com/gba/#gbfs">GBFS</a>.
      </p>
    </header>
    <p>
      gbfs-web was developed for and tested with
      <a href="https://mattiebee.dev/4-e">4-e</a>, a Game Boy Advance homebrew
      application that can emulate an e-Reader for Super Mario Advance 4.
    </p>

    <p>
      By following the simple steps below, you can take any ROM that supports
      GBFS, select files to attach, and save a new ROM with those files
      attached.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything is done locally in your browser. No ROM or file data is sent to
      or received from any server.
    </p>

    <h2>&#x2460; Pick a ROM</h2>
    <input id="rom" type="file" />

    <h2>&#x2461; Pick files to attach</h2>
    <input id="objects" type="file" multiple />

    <h2>&#x2462; Save the new ROM</h2>
    <button id="save">Save</button>
